MyStop-UniAssignment
====================

This is my main assignment for Monash FIT3027 in 2014.
It is a Public transport system alert application to help those people like me who fall asleep on the train, bus or tram and miss the
stop they are ment to get off at. This will send you an alert before you arrive at the station.  How is this different to the normal
iphone notification at location you ask, well this is built around the PTV or public transport network victoria data so the train or
stop locations are already in the app you just need to search or look through the list to select your desired stoping location.
